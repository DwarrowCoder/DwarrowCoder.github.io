            <h3>Elves</h3>
            <p>There are several varieties of elf found in the world of Toril.</p>
            <h4>Avariel (Winged Elf)</h4>
            <p>
The avariels, or winged elves, are one of the rarest subraces of elves.

            </p>
            <h4>Drow</h4>
            <p>
Descended from the original dark-skinned elven subrace called the Illythiiri, the drow were cursed into their present appearance by the good elven deities for following the goddess Lolth down the path to
evil and corruption. Also called dark elves, the drow have black skin that resembles polished obsidian and stark white or pale yellow hair. They commonly have very pale eyes in shades of lilac, silver, pink,
and blue. They also tend to be smaller and thinner than most elves. Most drow on the surface are evil and worship Vhaeraun, but some outcasts and renegades have a more neutral attitude.

            </p>
            <h4>Moon Elves</h4>
            <p>
Moon elves are the most common sort of elves in Faerûn. Also called silver elves, they have fair skin (sometimes tinged with blue) and hair of silver-white, black, or blue. (Humanlike colors are rare,
but possible.) Their eyes are blue or green, with gold flecks. They are the elven subrace most tolerant of humankind, and most half-elves are descended from moon elves.

            </p>
            <h4>Sun Elves</h4>
            <p>
Sun elves are less common across Faerûn than moon elves, because most live on Evermeet, where nonelves are not allowed. Also called gold elves, they have bronze skin, golden blond, copper, or black
hair, and green or gold eyes. These are seen as the most civilized and haughty elves, preferring to remain separate from nonelven races.

            </p>
            <h4>Wild Elves</h4>
            <p>
The very rare wild elves are rarely seen by others, because they live in the heart of thick forests and they have incredible skill at keeping hidden. Also called green elves, their skin tends to be dark brown,
and their hair ranges from black to light brown, lightening to silvery white with age.

            <h4>Wood Elves</h4>
            <p>
Wood elves are reclusive, but less so than the almost feral wild elves. Also called copper elves, they have coppery skin tinged with green, and brown, green, or hazel eyes. Their hair is usually brown or black,
with blond and coppery-red occasionally found.
