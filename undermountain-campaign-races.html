            <h3>Dwarves</h3>
            <p>There are several varieties of dwarf found in the world of Toril.</p>
            <h4>Arctic Dwarves</h4>
            <p>
            </p>

                <b>Ability Score Modifiers:</b> +2 Strength, +2 Constitution, -2 Charisma.<br>
                <b>Size:</b> Arctic dwarves are Small instead of Medium.<br>
                <b>Immunities:</b> Arctic dwarves are immune to cold damage.<br>
                <b>Regions:</b> Dwarf (arctic), The Great Glacier, The Spine of the World<br>

            </p>
            <h4>Gold Dwarves</h4>
            <p>
Unlike the shield dwarves, the gold dwarves maintained their great kingdom in the Great Rift and did not decline in terrible wars against evil humanoids. While they practiced some magic, they
never acquired the hubris that caused the downfall of some human nations. Confident and secure in their remote home, the gold dwarves gained a reputation for haughtiness and pride.
Since the Thunder Blessing, many young gold dwarves have left the Great Rift and are exploring the rest of Faerûn. The folk of other lands have learned that while some gold dwarves are aloof and
suspicious, for the most part they are forthright warriors and shrewd traders.

            </p>
            <h4>Gray Dwarves</h4>
            <p>
Long ago, mind flayers conquered the strongholds of clan Duergar of the dwarven kingdom of Shanatar. After generations of enslavement and cruel experimentation at the hands of the illithids, the
duergar rose against their masters and regained their freedom. They emerged as a new subrace of dwarf with limited mental powers. The gray dwarves are an evil and bitter race, but retain the superior
skill and workmanship of dwarvenkind. They have found a niche for themselves in the Underdark, creating armor and weapons to trade with the warring races of that realm. They seem to have
been denied the Thunder Blessing. Duergar on the whole are evil, but some turn their backs on their fellows and seek a different sort of life. For some, this means abandoning
the evil gods of the duergar and embracing the traditional dwarven pantheon, while for others it is a more practical betrayal, usually involving stealing from other gray dwarves. When discovered,
an outcast is typically stripped of his possessions, tattooed on the face and arms to mark him as a criminal, and cast out under penalty of death. Some clans secretly aid their outcasts—or encourage
them to leave before they are found out. To return is to die. This grim fate drives most outcasts to the surface, where they struggle to survive in an unwelcoming world. The surface dwarves
hate the duergar because they turned to evil, and no other surface races hold much love for the gray dwarves. Most of the gray dwarves met by surface dwellers are tattooed exiles, although a small number
were lucky or smart enough to leave before being discovered. Male and female duergar are bald, and women do not grown beards. They are much thinner than other dwarves, with severe
facial expressions, gray hair, and gray skin.

            <h4>Drow</h4>
            <p><a href="https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Drow">Forgotten Realms Wiki</a></p>
            <p>
Descended from the original dark-skinned elven subrace called the Illythiiri, the drow were cursed into their present appearance by the good elven deities for following the goddess Lolth down the path to
evil and corruption. Also called dark elves, the drow have black skin that resembles polished obsidian and stark white or pale yellow hair. They commonly have very pale eyes in shades of lilac, silver, pink,
and blue. They also tend to be smaller and thinner than most elves. Most drow on the surface are evil and worship Vhaeraun, but some outcasts and renegades have a more neutral attitude.

            </p>
            <h4>Moon Elves</h4>
            <p>
Moon elves are the most common sort of elves in Faerûn. Also called silver elves, they have fair skin (sometimes tinged with blue) and hair of silver-white, black, or blue. (Humanlike colors are rare,
but possible.) Their eyes are blue or green, with gold flecks. They are the elven subrace most tolerant of humankind, and most half-elves are descended from moon elves.

                Use the <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/races/core-races/elf">standard elf</a> for most features unless otherwise indicated.<br>
                <b>Regions:</b> Elf (moon), Elven Court, Evereska, Evermeet, Silverymoon, Waterdeep<br>
                <b>Random Height:</b> 4'10" + 2d10" (male), 4'5" + 2d10" (female)<br>

            </p>
            <h4>Star Elves</h4>
            <p>
Of all the elven subraces, star elves most closely resemble moon elves. They have pale skin that sometimes takes on a pearly gray or faintly violet tinge, and
hair of gold, red, or silver-white. Their eyes are gray or violet, sometimes with gold flecks. Like the sun elves or moon elves, star elves are tall and slender; men average between 5 1/2 and
6 feet in height and weigh around 140 pounds, while women are about half a foot shorter and weigh around 110 pounds. In their homes they favor elegant, embroidered tunics but
dress in neutral colors with dappled gray-green cloaks to remain unseen in woodlands. Star elves are graceful and strikingly handsome by human standards.

                <b>Ability Score Modifiers:</b> +2 Dexterity, -2 Constitution, +2 Charisma<br>
                <b>Otherworldly Touch:</b> Between sunset and sunrise a star elf confers the <i>ghost touch</i> ability on any melee weapon she wields and any armor she wears, but only so long as she
keeps the weapon in hand or wears the armor. Star elves have a magical affinity for starlight that gives them an unusual edge in fighting extradimensional foes. Replaces <b>Weapon Familiarity</b>.<br>
                <b>Extraplanar:</b> Star elves are not outsiders, but they are not native to Faerûn. Spells and effects that target extraplanar
creatures affect star elves. Banishment, dismissal, and similar effects that banish outsiders return a star elf to Sildëyuir.<br>
                <b>Regions:</b> Elf (star), Sildëyuir, The Yuirwood<br>
                <b>Random Height:</b> 4'10" + 2d10" (male), 4'5" + 2d10" (female)<br>
                <b>Random Weight:</b> 95 lb. + (1d6 &times; [height roll]) lb. (male), 75 lb. + (1d6 &times; [height roll]) lb. (female)<br>
            </p>
            <h4>Sun Elves</h4>
            <p>
Sun elves are less common across Faerûn than moon elves, because most live on Evermeet, where nonelves are not allowed. Also called gold elves, they have bronze skin, golden blond, copper, or black
hair, and green or gold eyes. These are seen as the most civilized and haughty elves, preferring to remain separate from nonelven races.

            </p>
            <h4>Wild Elves</h4>
            <p>
The very rare wild elves are rarely seen by others, because they live in the heart of thick forests and they have incredible skill at keeping hidden. Also called green elves, their skin tends to be dark brown,
and their hair ranges from black to light brown, lightening to silvery white with age.

            </p>
            <h4>Wood Elves</h4>
            <p>
Wood elves are reclusive, but less so than the almost feral wild elves. Also called copper elves, they have coppery skin tinged with green, and brown, green, or hazel eyes. Their hair is usually brown or black,
with blond and coppery-red occasionally found.
